This report analyzes transaction data to uncover patterns and trends. The dataset consists of transaction counts across different states, spanning multiple years and months. Various visualizations have been used to present insights into transaction distribution, temporal trends, and state-wise contributions.

Key Findings:
Transaction Distribution:
Transaction counts are mostly concentrated within a specific range, as shown in the histogram.
A majority of transactions fall below a threshold, with fewer extreme values.

Temporal Trends:
Transactions fluctuate over time, with noticeable peaks and dips.
Yearly trends indicate seasonal variations, as captured in the box plots.

State-wise Contribution:
The top 10 home states and sales states have been identified based on transaction counts.
A significant portion of transactions originates from a few key states.

Relationship between State Codes and Transactions:
Scatter plots highlight variations Ain transaction distribution across different states.
Certain states exhibit consistently high transaction volumes, suggesting economic hubs.

Visualizations:
A total of 20 plots have been created to support the analysis, including:
Histograms for transaction distribution.
Line plots showing trends over months and years.
Bar charts for state-wise transaction comparisons.
Box plots capturing variations in transaction volume.
Scatter plots for exploring relationships between variables.

Conclusion:
This analysis provides insights into transaction behavior, highlighting significant state-wise and temporal trends. The findings can help in identifying high-transaction regions and understanding seasonal variations, aiding better decision-making and forecasting in transaction-related domains.
